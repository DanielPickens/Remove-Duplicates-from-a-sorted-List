# Remove-Duplicates-from-a-sorted-List
My 7 line solution to the Leetcode: Remove Duplicates, that's faster than 95% &amp; takes up less memory than 88%

"
Given the head of a sorted linked list, delete all duplicates such that each element appears only once. Return the linked list sorted as well.

 

Example 1:


Input: head = [1,1,2]
Output: [1,2]
Example 2:


Input: head = [1,1,2,3,3]
Output: [1,2,3]
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 300].
-100 <= Node.val <= 100
The list is guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order."
